   <h1 id="title">My Parent's Love Story</h1>
	<p> Backstory:
	They met in Chazumba, Mexico. My mom's family was wealthy, they had the first color tv there, and her last name was well known. On the contrary, my dad's family were not wealthy because my grandpa died at a young age and my grandma was stuck raising six kids on her own.
	My mom was best friends with my dad's sister and so through her they met each other.
		
	Story:
	In the beginning, my dad disliked my mom because he though that she was self centered. In addition, my mom disliked my dad because of the way he behaved around others. 
	Overtime, my dad developed feelings over my mom but he finally had the time to ask my mom out. My mom denied but my aunt kept pressuring her to say yes. Time went on, my dad graduated, and he moved to the United States. During that time, my dad became a christian and one day while 
	he was eating soup, he remembered my mom. He called my aunt and asked her to give him my mom's phone number. My aunt agreed and a fae weeks later, they were calling each other everyday. A few years passed and my dad proposed to my mom over the phone. Twenty Four years later, they had 
	three kids and I guess you can say that my mom likes my dad now. :) </p>
